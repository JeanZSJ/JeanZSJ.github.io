      <h1>Notes on Investment</h1>
      <p class="lead">This is a quick recap of my experience with investing (with some book recommendations included!). Hopefully it’s useful for other beginners :D</p>
    </header>

    <article>
      <h2>What Is Investment?</h2>
      <p>You can buy lots of things: stocks, bonds, insurance, convertible issues &amp; warrants, real estate, paintings… the list goes on. But just buying a stock because some internet guru or a friend said it’ll rise next week? That doesn’t count as investing.</p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>“An investment operation is one which, upon thorough analysis, promises safety of principal and an adequate return. Operations not meeting these requirements are speculative.”</p>
        <cite>— Benjamin Graham, <em>The Intelligent Investor</em></cite>
      </blockquote>

      <p>The key words are <strong>thorough analysis</strong>, <strong>safety of principal</strong>, and <strong>adequate return</strong>.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Thorough Analysis</strong>: Before buying, do your homework. For stocks, ask: Do I know what the company makes? Does it have any real advantage? Is it financially healthy (check the 10‑K &amp; financials)? How do its prospects look? And even if everything looks great, are the shares <em>overpriced</em>? (Think: apples are great for your health, but paying $1,000 for an apple is ridiculous.)</li>
        <li><strong>Safety of Principal</strong>: Earning money is hard. Don’t throw it at products you don’t understand.</li>
        <li><strong>Adequate Returns</strong>: “Adequate” means different things to different people, but at minimum your reward should roughly match the effort and research you put in.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Why Invest?</h2>
      <p>If done carefully, investing can generate passive income that buys us both time and independence.</p>
      <p>A more personal reason: the “thorough analysis” part of investment allowed me to gain deeper insights into different companies, industries, macro events, and how almost everything is tied together. It provides a very powerful explanatory framework to understand why & how certain things are happening in this tumultuous world: Why is it that, while the Chinese solar industry is booming, the individual solar companies are suffering (btw the coal plants are doing very well)? What is the US going to do with its debt? Why does the Fed make XYZ decisions and how is it going to impact so and so? </p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>“Finance is the thread that runs through every aspect of life. It is indeed the knot where all the disparate strands of human existence come together.”</p>
        <cite>— Hernan Diaz, <em>Trust</em></cite>
      </blockquote>

      <p>It’s kind of like the physics of human society (almost).</p>

      <h2>How to Invest</h2>

      <h3>Where Do You Buy?</h3>
      <p>For U.S. products, there are platforms like Charles Schwab, Fidelity, JPMorgan Chase, Interactive Brokers, E*TRADE, and Merrill Edge. They all have slightly different vibes and features. I use Interactive Brokers since it works internationally.</p>

      <h3>What Can You Buy?</h3>
      <p>There’s a huge menu of things you could buy, but let’s focus on <strong>stocks</strong>.</p>
      <p>The guiding idea is simple: <em>buy low, sell high</em>. In technical terms: buy when undervalued, sell when overvalued. A crude example: if a stock’s worth $10, we’d buy at $5 and sell at $15.</p>

      <h3>Valuation Methods</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Discounted Cash Flow (DCF)</strong></p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>“The value of a stock is equal to the present value of its future cash flows. No more, no less.”</p>
            <cite>— Pat Dorsey, <em>The Five Rules for Successful Stock Investing</em></cite>
          </blockquote>
          <p>Buying stock = buying the <strong>right to future cash flows</strong>. That’s the leftover money after paying expenses, taxes, reinvestments — a.k.a. <strong>Free Cash Flow (FCF)</strong>. “Free” because it can go to shareholders (dividends, buybacks) or back into growth.</p>
          <p>Future cash is worth less than today’s, so we <strong>discount</strong> it. Two reasons:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Time value</strong>: today’s dollar can earn returns if invested.</li>
            <li><strong>Risk</strong>: future cash flows aren’t guaranteed.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>We also need a <strong>perpetuity value</strong> to cover the long tail beyond our forecast. Formula:</p>
          <p><code>Perpetuity Value = FCF<sub>n</sub> (1+g) / (R − g)</code></p>
          <p>Where <em>FCF<sub>n</sub></em> = final forecast-year cash flow, <em>g</em> = long‑term growth, <em>R</em> = discount rate. Then we discount that perpetuity back and add it in.</p>
          <p>This is what a comprehensive DCF looks like:</p>
          <figure>
            <img src="DCF.png" alt="DCF" width="600">
            <figcaption>A DCF Example from <em>The Five Rules for Successful Stock Investing </em>.</figcaption>
          </figure>          
          <div class="tip-box"><strong>Margin of Safety:</strong> In addition to valuing the stock using DCF, we might also apply a margin of safety, the size of which depends on our confidence in the firm. For example, if we are very pessimistic about Clorox’s prospects, we might set a 30% margin of safety and buy its shares only when they drop to (1 − 0.3) × $54.30 = $38.01.</div>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Multiples</strong></p>
          <p>When cash flows are messy (like in cyclical industries), we can use multiples to get a reality check. A few common ones:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>P/E</strong> = price ÷ earnings</li>
            <li><strong>P/B</strong> = price ÷ book value</li>
            <li><strong>P/S</strong> = price ÷ sales</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Compare them:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Horizontally</strong>: vs. other companies in the same industry</li>
            <li><strong>Vertically</strong>: vs. the company’s own historical data</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Where Do You Get Data?</h3>
      <p>There are pricey platforms like PitchBook and Capital IQ with detailed data. But sometimes your school has access (Yale does, thankfully!).</p>

      <h2>Summary</h2>
      <p>If you’re curious where to start, these two books are gold:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><em>The Five Rules for Successful Stock Investing</em> — super beginner‑friendly, walks through accounting basics, DCF, and industry analysis.</li>
        <li><em>The Intelligent Investor</em> — more philosophical, zoomed‑out wisdom.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>I’d start with <em>Five Rules</em> for grounding, then level up with Graham’s classic.</p>

      <div class="tip-box">
        <strong>Key Takeaways</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Investment = analysis, safety of principal, and adequate return.</li>
          <li>DCF helps you value stocks by forecasting cash flows.</li>
          <li>Multiples offer quick comparisons across peers and time.</li>

      </div>

      <p>I skipped over a lot here (like industry‑specific metrics and risk management). More to come! If you’ve got comments or questions, shoot me an email — I’d love to hear what you think.</p>
