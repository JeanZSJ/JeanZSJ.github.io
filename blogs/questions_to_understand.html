      <p><strong>Can AI help us better discover the laws of physics?</strong></p>
      <p>Many of our physical laws are approximations of what’s happening in the universe. Drag forces are not always proportional to velocity (that’s just an approximation within certain boundary conditions). F=ma is an approximation, as Einstein showed. Many of the things we compute, like small oscillations around equilibrium (which behaves approximately like a spring), a model of light as a point source…are approximations. To some extent, when we are doing physics, we are doing data-fitting work—-finding the right variables and relating them in the right way.</p>
      <p>And I think AI might be better at data-fitting than we do! It could discover more hidden variables than the human brain can. If we feed it enough data, could it discover new physics laws that fit natural phenomena? For example, if I collect all collectible data from the event of a ball falling down a hill, can it discover the approximation of F=mg and F_drag=-bv? How can we know what data to collect, and how much of it?</p>
      <p><strong>Is there a limit to simulation?</strong></p>
      <p>Can you simulate the universe with a quantum computer (and how does that work?)? How accurate and how precise can we make our simulations? How much computational resource does that require?</p>
      <p>More practically, can we simulate a cell/a human from the atom-level up to a reasonable extent (had to define what that means hahaha)? In that case, can we simulate, for example, a drug’s effect on the simulated human body, to the extent that it will replicate to a reasonable extent what will happen to the human body in real life?</p>
      <p><strong>Can we improve the resolution of our measurement?</strong></p>
      <p>Could there be one day that we can monitor and keep track of the activity of every atom in the human body? What does it take to do that? If we can do it, can we transfer that data into a simulation?</p>
      <p>What is the resolution of our measurement devices now? </p>
